h1. Sparks

Sparks is a rails plugin for handling static file content in your app.


h2. To install:

<code>
  script/plugin install git@github.com:lodestone/sparks.git
</code>

<code>
  script/generate sparks
</code>

Add this line as the last route in config/routes.rb:
<code>
 map.spark '*:sparkpath', :controller => 'static', :action => 'file'
</code>
 


h2. How to use

This plugin allows you to drop in "static" files into your Rails app that will use the app layout and templating (erb, haml, etc).

Example:

/app/views/static/about-us.html.haml:
<pre>
<code>
 %h1 About Us
 .about
   We are great.

</code>
</pre>

Now you get <your-app>/about-us and <your-app>/about-us.html.

You can also have nested paths like /about/us by creating sub-directories under app/views/static.
 

Really this is pretty dead-simple.
